# Startup Injured Script

Enhance your roleplay server with this dynamic Injury System Script. Designed to add depth and realism to player experiences, this script introduces a sophisticated injury mechanic where players' health impacts their movement and gameplay.

**Features:**

Customizable Health Reduction: Configure the amount of health (HP) that players lose periodically when injured. Tailor the intensity of the injury effect to fit your server's needs.

**Dynamic Notifications:**

Choose between OKOK Notify and ESX Default Notifications to alert players when they are injured. Customize the message players receive upon injury to suit your server's atmosphere.

**Screen Effect:**

Immerse players with visual effect like screen shake, signaling their deteriorating condition.

**Automatic Recovery:**

Players automatically regain their normal state once their health improves above a certain threshold, seamlessly transitioning back to regular gameplay.

**Death Reset:**

If a player dies, the injury state is reset, ensuring a clean slate upon respawn.

**Easy to Configure:**

With straightforward configuration options, you can effortlessly adjust the script to fit your server's unique roleplay style. Simply edit the config.lua file to toggle features, set custom values, and ensure a smooth integration with your existing setup.

**How It Works:**

When a playerâ€™s health drops below a specified level, the script triggers a series of effects and notifications to indicate their injured status. As long as they remain injured, their health will gradually decrease, adding a strategic challenge to surviving in your server's world.
